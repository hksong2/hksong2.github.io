Today, I worked on the basic logic for my Hangman game and broke the code into three functions. The first function, choose_word, selects a random word from a file to use in the game. The second function, display_word, is intended to show the current state of the word, filling in the correct letters and showing underscores for the ones that haven’t been guessed yet. The third part, which is the actual Hangman game, handles the player’s guesses, checks if they’re correct, and keeps track of the attempts remaining.

Initially, I wasn’t sure how I wanted to handle the “word bank” aspect of the game, but I ultimately decided to use the file steps we learned in class. Alternatively, I could have put a giant list with a bunch of words in the function directly, but I feel like text files are more convenient / flexible? I’m not sure. I might eventually use different text files with words that are different levels of difficulty, if I can find the time. 

I didn’t find the basic game logic to be too difficult— I defined some variables to keep track of the moving parts. For example, I used a guessed_letters set to keep track of the letters that were already guessed. I gave the player 6 guesses (to represent the head, two arms, two legs, and body of a typical hangman), but I’m open to changing the number in the future. 

The display_word function was the trickiest for me. I haven’t quite been able to work this part out yet, but I think there should be a simple solution involving iterating through the randomly chosen word. I think my brain is a little fried from staring at my screen for too long, so I plan to revisit this tomorrow. 

I haven’t yet considered how to implement a GUI yet, but I want to get the basic game logic up and running before I explore that. However, it is something to consider next week.
