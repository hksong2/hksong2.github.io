Today, I refined the Hangman game’s core logic, focusing on ending the game correctly when the player guesses the word, keeping capitalization consistent, and getting the display_word function to work. In the play_hangman function, I ran into a bit of an issue where the game would keep going until the guesses got to 0, regardless if the word was already guessed or not, so I implemented a guessed_word_complete flag to ensure the game naturally ends when the word is fully guessed. I also used .lower() to ensure all the capitalization was consistent (ex: an inputted “A” and “a” should be considered the same.)

I was able to get my display_word function up and running correctly. The function iterates through each letter in the word and checks if it is in variable guessed_letters. If it is, the letter is added to the output string, followed by a space; otherwise, an underscore (_) and a space are added. The function returns the resulting string with trailing spaces removed, showing guessed letters in their correct positions while keeping unguessed ones hidden.

For the word bank, I was able to find a word bank text file online (on GitHub, actually.) It’s just a file with a whole bunch of words in alphabetical order. I downloaded the text file and moved it to the correct Drive folder, so I now have a working and comprehensive word bank to work with. 

Now that I have the game logic working, I plan to design a console-based “GUI” using symbols to visually represent the Hangman scaffold and player progress.
