Today, I created the display_hangman function to visually represent the player's progress as they make incorrect guesses. It takes the number of remaining attempts as input and displays the hangman figure accordingly. It uses a list of predefined stages created with slashes, absolute value signs, and other typed symbols. Each stage corresponds to a different level of the figure—starting with just the scaffold and progressing through various stages as the player loses more attempts (head, body, arms, legs). This gives a visual representation of the hangman drawing as the game progresses.

The main challenge I encountered was ensuring the hangman figure updated correctly after each incorrect guess, which I resolved by linking the number of attempts to the correct stage in the list. It also took quite a bit of time just figuring out the spacing and symbols and such to create a convincing enough hangman figure. 

Next, I hope to potentially implement different difficulty levels? I’d need to figure out what words are considered “difficult” and “easy” and such, so I’m not sure how I’d implement this yet.
