For my final work on this project, I just tidied up my code and made final tweaks. I realized that I just simply didn't have enough time to pursue any major additions or adjustments to my code. I adjusted some of the visual spacing between the lines, but besides that, I spent most of my time putting together a final presentation.

Overall, I had a good time working through this project. I’m glad I was able to get a working (even if it is simple) game running, all built from scratch. 

My tip to future students learning programming fundamentals is to spend time mastering the basics, like loops, conditionals, functions, and data structures! These are the building blocks for nearly everything you’ll write in programming. I don’t think I spent enough time on them at the beginning of the semester, which forced me to backtrack later and master them before I was able to tackle slightly more complex problems.

Also, (I know these are two tips but I feel like both are important) I’d like to stress the importance of breaking problems down. I initially had a hard time solving problems because I simply didn’t know how to approach them and got intimidated. However, breaking problems down will help you see that even more complex problems are just simpler parts of a whole, and are usually totally achievable.
