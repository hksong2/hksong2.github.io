## About Me

Hi, my name is Hannah Song, and I'm a senior at University Laboratory High School. In my free time I enjoy walking my dog, painting, and baking. I have minimal experience with coding, but I hope to learn more as I go through college and beyond! 

## About My Project

My project is an interactive, text-based Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word. It features a game loop that displays the hangman graphic, the partially guessed word, and remaining attempts. Players input guesses, and the game validates them, updates the word or reduces attempts for incorrect guesses, and provides feedback. The game ends with a win when the word is fully guessed or a loss when attempts run out.
